Below you can find general details about the process of Irumudi Pooja and Kettu Nira. Please check / follow the procedures mentioned by your Guruswami.

Irumudi (literally meaning Iru = two and Mudi = Knot/Bundle) is the second most significant material process after Mala dharana (material process differentiated from Vrata Anushtanas, which is essential and mandatory spiritual practice explained in the first part). Before we come to the ingredients, the front compartment is called Munmudi (the bundle in the front) This has offerings for Lord Ayyappa and other Deities in Sannidhanam. The rear compartment called Pinmudi (the bundle at the rear) has the ingredients meant for Pilgrim’s use enroute. Tying of this together signifies binding of the Bhakta with Ayyappa. and non-duality between devotee & devoted. They become a single Whole and are no longer two different entities.

**Mudra Coconut:** Process of preparing it for Filling ghee. This is the Coconut that is defibred and cleaned, water removed and Ghee filled during the Irumudi Kattu process. Extremely important offering for Lord Ayyappa as this is the coconut into which we fill Ghee for performing Abhishekam to the moorthi of the Lord.

**Mudra/Ghee Coconut (Nei Thengai):**
* Place the Mudra Coconut above rice and remove the cork.
* Pour ghee carefully while chanting "Nei Abhishega Priyanae – Saranam Ayyappa."
* Cork and seal the coconut using wax, then apply vibhuti, sandal, and kumkum.
* Place the coconut inside the small bag with rice and Kanikkai.

For Pilla Kattu, the procedure ends here, and the Irumudi will be placed on the child.

**Mun Mudi (Front of Irumudi):**
* Fill the Mun Mudi with rice while chanting "Annadhana Prabhuvae – Saranam Ayyappa."
* Place offerings (money, prasadam) and the Mudra Coconut inside the Mun Mudi.

**Pin Mudi (Back of Irumudi):**
* Family members can participate by adding rice to the Pin Mudi.
* The Guruswami will tie the Irumudi Bag to complete the process.

**Receiving the Irumudi:**
